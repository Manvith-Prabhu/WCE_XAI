# Explainable AI on Wireless Capsule Endoscopy

## Introduction
This repository houses the code and resources associated with our research on classifying frames as bleeding or non-bleeding in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images using deep learning (DL) models. We emphasize explainable AI (XAI) by leveraging Grad-CAM for enhanced interpretability, enabling better understanding of model decision-making and facilitating targeted improvement efforts.
